Hackday Toolkit
===============
I'm interested in finding out what packages people have used at hack events.

There are two purposes for this:

1) I'd like to see if it is possible to assemble a powerful toolkit onto a USB memory stick - so that you can come armed to a hack event with that, and not have to fight others for wi-fi bandwidth.

2) I'd love to find out (and help others find out) what cute technologies people are using to strap projects together.

Please fork, and add your favourite hackday packages to the list here:

/_sources/packages.txt

And any fun public APIs here:

/_sources/apis.txt

..then make a pull request and I'll integrate.

Any comments or feedback also welcome!

James.
