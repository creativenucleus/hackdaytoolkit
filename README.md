Hackday Toolkit
===============
I'm interested in finding out what packages people have used at hack events.

There are two purposes for this:

1) I'd like to see if it is possible to put together a toolkit for memory sticks - so that you can come armed to a hack event with that, and not have to fight others for wi-fi bandwidth.

2) I'd love to find out (and help others find out) what cute technologies people are using to strap projects together.

Please fork, and add your favourite hackday packages the list here:

/_sources/packages.txt

..then make a pull request and I'll integrate.

Any comments or feedback also welcome!

James.
